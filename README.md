# Real Life Violence Detection using Python

## Overview
This repository contains code for detecting real-life violence in videos using Python. The project utilizes deep learning techniques for video analysis and classification.

## Introduction
Real-life violence detection is a crucial task in video surveillance and security systems. This project aims to develop a robust solution using deep learning algorithms to automatically detect violent behavior in videos. The model is trained on a labeled dataset containing both violent and non-violent activities.

## Setup
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
- Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
To use the violence detection system, follow these steps:
- Prepare your video dataset and ensure it is properly formatted.
- Use the provided scripts or integrate the detection module into your application.
- Run the detection algorithm on your videos and analyze the results.

## Data Augmentation
Data augmentation is a critical step in improving the generalization of deep learning models. This project includes various data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, flipping, and resizing to enhance the training dataset's diversity and robustness.

## Model Training
The model is trained using PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning. We employ a deep neural network architecture tailored for video classification tasks. The training process includes optimization techniques such as learning rate scheduling and model checkpointing to achieve better performance.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the trained model, we use standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we provide visualization tools to analyze model predictions and identify areas for improvement.

## Results
We present the results of our violence detection system, including quantitative performance metrics and qualitative analysis of model predictions. The system's effectiveness is demonstrated through real-world examples and comparisons with existing methods.
